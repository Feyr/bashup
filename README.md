# bashup
Simply Python Key Bashing Program

Important - starts up in full screen, and needs you to press ESC AND p together to quit.
This is so it can't be exited by accident

## Requirements

pygame, and python. That should be it.

## What does it do?

* Bounces a square on the screen off the edges.
* The square changes colour if you press the space bar.
* You can change the speed by pressing the cursor keys up/down.
* You can change the size by pressing the cursor keys left/down.

## What will it do?

Hopefully, when I get time:

* Fade between colours
* Leave a limited trail - configurable to be longer or shorter
* Display more details - speed, FPS, directions, etc.
* Make a sound when it hits the edge
* Display pictures instead of a square - change the picture on each bounce, or press of the space bar instead
of colours
* Add more bouncing items on screen

## The code is awful!

This is my first python program, which I've cobbled together from a few examples.
I know lots of things will need to change to accomodate the features I want to add.

## This is boring!

Well, it's just a pet project for me to make a 'game' for my toddler, that can't easily be escaped out
of, and can just be left running on a Pi.
